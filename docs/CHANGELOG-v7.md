# Revision 7 — the invitation-card pivot

Revision 7 changes what the product makes. The AI no longer generates a custom event website; it
designs **one digital invitation card** — generated artwork with real text set over it — delivered
in an envelope that opens, above a standard event page in one neutral house style. RSVP, guests,
registry, roles, publishing and the prompt-first flow carry over.

This file is the record of the decision. Revision 6 documents, proofs and evidence were deleted
with the pivot by owner decision; git history is their archive (the last commit carrying them is
`e86e7e9`).

## Why

- **The website did not clear the creative bar.** Human Test #1 reviewers read the generated sites
  as "well-typeset flyers": typography overreach, decorative monograms dominating, no thematic
  anchor. An AI review of the same sheets rated the hand-authored library — the best the
  composition language could express when a person wrote it — no better than the model, which put
  the ceiling in the language itself.
- **What reviewers wanted was an invitation.** Their reference designs were invitations: an
  illustrated anchor, supporting motifs, a border, a palette drawn from the artwork, restrained
  typography.
- **A card is a tractable creative problem.** One fixed canvas instead of a responsive multi-section
  page removes responsive layout, per-concept geometry verification and the diversity machinery, and
  concentrates the "it read my mind" moment in the object the host actually sends.

## Decisions made with the owner

| Question | Decision |
| --- | --- |
| What is generated? | One invitation card (Paperless-Post-style), revealed from an envelope; event details stay standard |
| Existing website code, proofs, Human Test #1 survey | Deleted now; reusable pieces kept for the card |
| How guests receive it | Both: host shares a link/QR, and the platform can send personal invitations |
| Channels for platform invitations | Text only |
| Personal invitation link | Identifies the party (no SMS code) and skips the private event code |
| AI-written wording | Yes — a title and invitation line, editable; facts only from the host |
| Artwork | Every card has generated artwork; it may be minimal (a border or texture) |
| Card shape | Portrait (about 5×7), front only |
| Designs per round | One at a time, with `Try another direction` |
| Host edits without AI | Words and font (among the design's curated pairings) |
| Page under the card | One neutral house style for every event |
| Private event, shared link | Sealed envelope with the event title until the code is entered |
| Image model | Decided by a bake-off |
| Database | No migration in this pass; the card-data phase replaces the website tables |
| Superseded docs | Deleted; git history only |
| Price | Keep $49 one-time as the hypothesis |

## Defaults chosen in writing Revision 7

Smaller choices made to keep the documents consistent. Each is canonical in the place cited and can
be changed there:

- the first card generated for an event becomes active automatically; later cards only when chosen
  (`spec.md §7.11`);
- the card's title is the event's title: a host-supplied title is used verbatim, otherwise the
  design drafts one (`spec.md §7.3`, `§20.2`);
- the font control offers the design's primary pairing plus up to two alternates the design names
  (`spec.md §7.14`, `card-system.md §2.6`);
- facts reach the draft through a separate cheaper extraction call, not the Event Identity
  (`spec.md §7.5`) — this resolves an open question Revision 6.1 left unresolved;
- invitations can be sent only after publish, after a one-time host attestation, within a small
  per-party cap (`spec.md §7.18`, `§13.2`);
- the host can copy and rotate any party's personal link after publish (`spec.md §12.5`);
- all card text must clear 4.5:1 contrast; an art-derived legibility panel is applied when no ink
  can (`card-system.md §4.2`);
- inspiration images go to Event Identity only, never to the image model (`spec.md §7.6a`);
- a failed generation is shown honestly with a retry; there is no template or stock fallback
  (`card-system.md §3`);
- the card-reveal latency target is a working ~30 s at p75 until the bake-off measures a real image
  model (`spec.md §7.10`).

## What changed in the documents

| Document | Change |
| --- | --- |
| `spec.md` | Revision 7 rewrite. New §7 journey (card design, artwork, compilation, reveal, try another direction, send invitations), §11 card architecture, §12.5 personal links, §13 invitations, §14.2 sealed envelope, §20 card editing, §24 domain model, §31 acceptance criteria regrouped, §32 guardrails rewritten (47) |
| `docs/card-system.md` | **New.** The card architecture; replaces `event-renderer-system.md` |
| `docs/product-doctrine.md` | Rewritten for the card; same principles (understanding, facts vs interpretation, clarification, no decisions for the host) |
| `docs/model-contracts.md` | Revision 3: Event Identity v3, fact extraction, Card Design, Card Art, the creative-understanding evaluation |
| `docs/model-prompts/event-identity.system.md`, `docs/model-schemas/event-identity.schema.json` | v3: removed `compatibleTonalDirections` and `compatibleFamilies`; `visualMotifs` names subjects for the artwork |
| `docs/technology-decisions.md` | Headless Chromium retired; image model added, undecided (§8.1) |
| `docs/design-system.md`, `docs/e2e-workflow.md`, `docs/screen-spec.md` | Rewritten for the card, envelope, house-style page and invitations |
| `docs/development-plan.md` | Re-sequenced: bake-off → card compiler/renderer → generation → Creation Mode → guests/RSVP → registry → publish and invitations → launch |
| `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, `docs/README.md`, `.claude/agents/*` | Re-pointed at the card architecture |

## Deleted

Documents: `docs/event-renderer-system.md`, `docs/CHANGELOG-v5.md`, `docs/CHANGELOG-v6.md`,
`docs/reconciliation-audit.md`, `docs/renderer-invariant-obligations.md`,
`docs/phase-3-reference-defects.md`, `docs/phase-3/`, `docs/human-test-1/`, `docs/renderer-tests/`,
`docs/spike/`, `docs/prototypes/`, `docs/history/`, the DesignIntent and Composition prompts and
schemas and their histories.

Code: the composition language, compiler, planner, legacy library, geometry verifier and primitive
renderer; `proof-a1/`, `proof-b/`; the Human Test #1 survey; the geometry spike; their scripts,
tests and fixtures; the `renderer-proof` CI job; `@sparticuz/chromium`.

Kept for the card: `src/lib/card/color.ts` (WCAG/OKLCH colour maths), `src/lib/card/typography.ts`
(twelve curated pairings), `public/fonts/card/` and `src/styles/card-fonts.css`.

## Still open

Tracked in `docs/product-doctrine.md §14`: the image model and its workflow; the layout catalog and
slot limits; the reveal latency target; the $49 re-check; the clarification question schema; an
email provider for the reminder fallback.
